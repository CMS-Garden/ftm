# Follow the Money

This project is a centralized knowledge database to provide transparency on the current state of web-based systems in the public sector. In detail, we provide:

- Open data: An overview of government web systems, their funding, and stakeholders.
- Maintenance state: Providing maintenance stats (e.g., used components, versions, known security vulnerabilities) of web systems.
- FOSS information: Percentage of Open Source based web systems.

We're dedicated to fostering an open-source community within the public sector. Streamlining public funding to promote collaboration and innovation, instead of finger pointing.

## Vision

We provide transparency to the web-based system landscape of the public sector. With the principle of "public money, public code", we encourage the use of open-source technologies to foster maintainability and innovation in the public sector.

## Project Scope

- Providing an overview of the public web system inventory.
- Making government websites a safer place.
- Providing additional software information for websites of public institutions.

## Project Context

- Governments spend large amounts of money on the development of web-based systems but often end up with closed-source, hard to maintain systems.
- Government institutions often outsource software development, which, among other things, leads to a lack in IT knowledge, and a lack of awareness about maintainability and Open Source software development.
- Lately, government websites have been the primary target of hackers to destabilize democracies, and gain access to internal infrastructure.

## Current Project Limitations

- Only websites of government entities listed on [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org/) are considered at the moment.
- The detailed software component analysis currently focuses on CMS systems. It is planned to extend this at a later point in time for other system types as well.
