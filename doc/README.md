# Follow the Public Money
This project is a centralised knowledge database to provide transparency for the current state of web based systems in the public secotor. In detail we provide:

- Transparency: With an overview of government web systems, their funding, and stakeholders.
- Maintainence state: Providing maintenance stats (e.g. used components, versions, known security vulnerabilities) of web systems.
- FOSS information: Percentage of Open Source based web systems.

We're dedicated to fostering an open source community within the public sector, promoting collaboration and innovation, instead of practicing finger pointing.
